Zoe Requirements from Dean (9/9/2019):

 * offer safety
 * synchronous computation
 * contracts that spawn other contracts
 * contracts that use other contracts
 * continuous contracts (services)
 * helps with in general the notion of deployment
 * the framework that limits our computation to things that we can
   implement efficiently and safely
   - i.e. persistence in certain forms is easy in Zoe
